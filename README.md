# Ferment_App
This app aims to be simple to use. All it needs to do is allow the user to input info or choose from previously saved info. Then all it needs to do is send notification and updates to the user about there process.
It will be a windows exclusive app for the foreseeable future. It will set itself up as a windows running serivce so it can keep track of the time and date.
Obviously this would work infintly better when running on a server but those cost money and this app is simple and free!
